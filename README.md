# Re-disc-tribution
Datapack that changes how and where the original music discs are acquired in the game. 

While the skeleton-killing-a-creeper mechanic is a fun one, it feels like it offers way too much disc variety. 
Meanwhile, old game mechanics and structures reward no unique disks at all! 
This datapack, inspired by newer updates, will re-distribute some of these older discs around the game.

Changes made by this pack:

- Since this is already a thing in Bedrock Edition, Mellohi and Wait now generate in buried treasure chests.
- 11 can be found in Mineshafts, along with Cat and 13.
- Stal now generates in Woodland Mansions.
- Ward can generate in a Jungle Temple, or (with a lower chance) in a Desert Pyramid
- Villagers (of any profession) will sometimes reward you with Mall for beating a raid.
- Usual skeleton method now will only provide discs 13, Cat, Blocks, Chirp, and Far. If a skeleton kills a creeper that is *charged*, it will drop Strad instead. Good luck.
